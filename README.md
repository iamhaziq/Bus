Rafiqi Razak
-I assigned the workload according to the number of members. I assigned myself with making the main class. I took heed of the errors and bugs that may occur and fixed them. Other than that, I also adjusted the functions accordingly to make it as user-friendly as possible, with making the interface look pleasant. I also completed the coding and finalized the coding. Lastly, I initiated the group meetings and contacted the group members to see their progress.

Brief Description
The purpose of this program is to purchase and book tickets for a bus. The users are shown a main menu with the first option for just displaying the available and unavailable seats. The second option is where the users can book the ticket. They are required to put in their names and id number for confirmation. The destinations are set to Penang, Melaka and Johor from Kuala Lumpur. The users are displayed with the available and unavailable seatings with the symbol "#" for available and "*" for unavailable. The price for different seats also differs, for example, a single seat costs more than a window seat, while the aisle double seat costs more than the window double seat. Once the seat has been booked, the seat will be displayed as unavailable, and other users may no longer select that particular seat. The ticket is finally printed out with the credentials that have been provided from the beginning of the process along with the price and destination.


Users are prompted to enter either choice 1 or 2
